# Purpose 

The purpose of the repository is to gain an understanding of PointNet and try it out for myself for the purpose of my Final Year Project (FYP). My FYP will look into 3D Object Detection Algorithms and PointNet is the basis feature extractor for many 3D Object Detection Algorithms which is why PointNet is of interest to me. The code repository was taken from [Fei Xia](https://github.com/fxia22/pointnet.pytorch). I have investigated the details of the algorithms and reported it here (and in my FYP).
